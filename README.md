## A list of CSR and SSR Charts implemented in the nextjs app

### Nivo

Supports both CSR and SSR implementation.
For SSR implementation you need to pull, install and run a [nivo-api](https://github.com/plouc/nivo-api) repo localy on [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)
To test the SSR disable javascript in browser and reload [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). As a result only SSR supported charts should render.

### Chart.js

Supports only CSR.

### Lightweight Chart

Supports only CSR.
